## Project Overview

Fore Golf is a fictitious ecommerce full stack project built using Django, Python, JavaScript and Bootstrap 4. The site is deployed to Heroku, uses Amazon S3 for cloud storage and Stripe for payment processing. Fore Golf is a business to customer online retailer full of all types of golf equipment.

Fore Golf is my fifth milestone project for Code Institute's Level 5 Diploma in Full Stack Software Development.

## Planning
### Balsamiq Wireframes
 
I created a Wireframe for this project to get a rough idea what my design idea for this project would look like using [Balsamiq - wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/). But I also created this so I could focus more on designing the actual website instead of having to think too much about how the design for this project would look while building the project.
Since the wireframes are an idea of how I think the website would look like before I started coding, the finished website isn't 100% look alike.
